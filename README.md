Wavefront map editor

![Alt text](sample/preview.png)

    It is a old project beginning in 2011, its need to be updated with the latest version of Qt.

    This software help the user to create a world like MineCraft.
    It can export the result in Wavefront format with both a ojb file and a mtl file:

    Any help to improve the project is okay.

    Last update:

    - OpenGL Preview doesn't work... The code need to be updated (file src/opengl/opengl class)
    - Added some sample but without the OpenGL Preview... :(
